Hello, my name is Abhishek Singh and i am form delhi, and I have a full stack developer. With 1 years of experience in web development, I have a strong command over both front-end and back-end technologies, allowing me to build complete and scalable applications.

Moving to the back end, I’m proficient in server-side languages like Python, Java, or Node.js. I have extensive experience working with databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, and I can design efficient database structures and write optimized queries. I’m familiar with RESTful APIs and know how to integrate them into applications to enable seamless communication between the front end and back end.
